# Undead Sass

## Scss and Gulp exercise

### Goals

_in your own forked repo_

1. Setup a [Gulp+Sass+LiveReload](https://gist.github.com/kellishouts/2c7cde625491ad53fb3c) workflow so that gulp watches and compiles sass files to a public css directory.

2. Use scss to style `index.html` so that it matches the layouts in the `layouts` directory. You can view the [complete demo project](http://gomagames.com/undead/) to inspect styles.

7. You should be able to complete this exercise without modifying the html at all.

_Refer to the demo project and use the Chrome inspector. It is more important that you focus on setting up proper scss structure, rather than spending time to figure out all the css properties on your own._
